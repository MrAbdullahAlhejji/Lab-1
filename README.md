# Lab 1: Getting Started with Git & GitHub

In this lab, I explored the basics of version control systems. 
- Created a GitHub account.
- Learned how to initialize a local repository using Git.
- Practiced basic Git commands: `add`, `commit`, and `push`.
- Connected my local environment (VS Code) to a remote repository on GitHub.
